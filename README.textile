h1. ModelBasedHtml

This plugin enables the binding of other html elements to models, just like form_for.

An example says it all:

  <% definition_list_for @user do |dl| %>

    <%= dl.dt :login %>
    <%= dl.dd :login %>

    <%= dl.dt :email %>
    <%= dl.dd :email do |mail_address| %>
      <%= mail_to mail_address %>
    <% end %>

  <% end %>
    
The dt method will automatically display the human_attribute_name of this 
attribute, the dd will automatically show the value of this attribute. You can 
pass a block to these methods to play with the value even more, like making it 
a link. Because these values may be harmful, a dd_h method is also available,
sanitizing html automatically. You can limit it to one line, using dt_and_dd or dt_and_dd_h.

A table_for is also under development.

Please note that this plugin is still very much under development. Use at your own risk.
